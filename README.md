A top-down shooter game. A personal project mostly to mess around with Python.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Weapon Select:
Press 1-9 to select or deselect your loadout of weapons. It will assign you the first 3 selected weapons in the list. 
Use Z, X, and C to select the difficulty. When you are done, press Enter.

The Game:

Unpause the game with Space. Controls are WASD + Mouse. Use Left Click to fire, Right Click to change weapon. When you die, press "O" to respawn. When you run out of enemies, press "P" to spawn more.

The red globes are dropped by enemies when you kill them. Pick them up to gain health.

Enemies:

Red - Basic enemies that fire a single shot when you come within range. They'll just bounce around and fire at you if they see you.

Yellow - Fast enemies that fire low-damage, high-rate machine guns when they come within range. They just bounce.

Green - Motherships that spawn basic enemies. They don't fire and move slowly, but they'll make your day worse if you leave them alone.

Grey - Enemies armed with high-damage shotguns. The falloff on these weapons is quite high, but if you let them get close you can be killed in a single shot. If you get too close to them, they'll start chasing you.

Purple - Like the shotgunners, these will chase you if you get close enough. They are armed with short-range hitscan beam weapons that increase in damage each shot. 

Turqoise - These enemies will tell the others where you are. Suddenly basic enemies will be as smart as shotgunners, and so in order to be smarter the player pulls out the rocket launcher.
